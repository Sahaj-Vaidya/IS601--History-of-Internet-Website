    <title>The Invention of Internet</title>

<h1> How did Internet come into Existence?</h1>
<body>
<p>
    Whenever we encounter the term internet, we can immediately think of the
    expansive and rapidly changing technology that has evolved to become
    the backbone of the modern era revolution. We cannot attribute the progress of internet to a single person. It is the outcome of fruitful collaboration of number of scientists, programmers, engineers who each contributed their own share to eventually bring the internet to it’s current form.
    Long before the techniques to build internet were under development,
    scientists around the world had already anticipated of such a connected network.
    Nikola Tesla put forward the idea of “world wireless system” around 1900s, whereas highly
    intellectual Paul Outlet and Vannevar Bush conceived the idea of mechanical search system
    for storage of books and media in mid 1900s. Shortly after this, computer scientists
    invented the concept of “packet switching” in networking which is a method for transmission of
    electronic data which would go on to become one of the central building blocks of internet architecture.

    ARPANET which came in late 1960s can be considered as one the first
    working prototypes for modern internet. It was originally funded by the US Department of Defense
    which allowed multiple systems to communicate over a single network.
    The technology continued to flourish thereafter and soon the model of TCP/IP was introduced.
    This set a standard for transmission of data on multiple networks.
    This protocol was adopted by ARPANET in 1980s which gave a boost to the online world.

<p> However, ARPANET had a drawback, it wasn’t mobile. The computer using ARPANET were enormous in size occupying a lot of space and the communication wasn’t dynamic. For ARPANET to be useful for world beyond that of researchers in Cambridge or Menlo Park, it was necessary to connect it via wireless network.
    This ARPANET is usually confused with modern internet, however the internet that we recognize today was invented by Tim Berners Lee in 1990 with World Wide Web. The Web is actually a means to access online data with the help of websites and hyperlinks. But Web helped to popularize and increase the accessibility of the vast ocean of information which all of now consume on a daily basis. Since the birth of World Wide Web, internet has changed in many ways. In 1992, a group of researchers at University of Illinois developed a web browser called “Mosaic” which later became famous as “Netscape”. This offered a user-friendly way to search for information across the Web. It allowed the users to scroll through thousands of images and navigate through different pages which was a first of it’s kind experience for users in that age.

    The architects of internet designed a common language that could be used for transmission of
    data across any network. Eventually these rules became the lingua franca of the internet architecture.
    During the same period of time, Congress decided to commercialize the Web.
    The reason behind the jubilant victory of internet is it’s flexibility. It fetches data to and from billions
    of devices conveying our messages across variety of network in fraction of second’s time.

<p>
    One of the most important thing to understand about the roots of internet is that it developed from a military application. The group of people of who built the internet understood it’s design implications and hence tailored it to fulfil those requirements accordingly. The reason internet works across any device, at any given corner of the globe is because it is needed to be ubiquitous as the security apparatus that financed it’s development. By binding different networks together so seamlessly, makes internet feel like a single space on it’s own. And this network has been expanding ever since it’s inception creating an ease to accessibility of information for people.
